# Headwaters Exhibit at OMSI

This exhibit teaches about the isotope levels in water as it travels from the mountains to a low elevation.

The user can switch between normal climate, drought climate, and high snowpack climates. The colors of the streams and river sections changes based on the amount of water that flows during that climate. Each button represents a specific "testing site" in a stream or river, including the elevation details and the isotope count for that climate at that area. When the button is pushed, the information is printed on a sheet of receipt paper.

The photo below of the exhibit is not of the final exhibit. In the final exhibit, the buttons are labeled for what section of the streams / river they represent, and there are labels to identify the elevations.
